## What makes an animation feel right?
- Natural Movement: Animations feel better when they mimic natural movement rather than using linear timing, which feels robotic. Real-world objects don't move at constant speeds, which is why easing and spring animations create more pleasing experiences.
- Meaningful Purpose: Good animations should have clear meaning and purpose, connecting actions to consequences in logical ways. They should help users understand relationships between different states of the interface.
- Tasteful Implementation: Taste is a critical factor in whether animations feel good, and this skill can be developed with practice and experience. Finding the right balance is essential - animations should enhance without overwhelming.
- Web Challenges: Creating natural animations on the web is particularly challenging due to the abstraction layer of mouse/keyboard interaction (vs. touch) and technical limitations compared to native platforms, but proper easing and thoughtful design can still achieve excellent results.

## The Easing Blueprint
I use different easing types depending on what I'm animating:

- Ease-out: My most frequently used curve for UI work. Great for user-initiated interactions like opening modals because the initial acceleration creates a responsive feeling. I apply this for most enter and exit animations.
- Ease-in-out: Starts slowly, speeds up, then slows down at the end (like a car). This creates the most satisfying visual flow. I use it for on-screen elements that need to move to new positions or transform.
- Ease-in: Starts slowly and ends fast. I generally avoid this as it can make interfaces feel sluggish and unresponsive.
- Linear: Moves at constant speed, creating robotic motion. I only use this for continuous animations like loading spinners or marquees where there's no interaction.
- Ease: Similar to ease-in-out but asymmetrical (starts faster, ends slower). I typically use this for hover effects that transition color, background, or opacity.

I've found that built-in CSS easing curves often don't have strong enough acceleration, so I frequently use custom cubic-bezier curves for more energetic, natural-feeling animations.
The perception of speed is often more important than actual performance - proper easing can make interfaces feel faster even when the duration stays the same. When in doubt, I refer to my easing blueprint and experiment with different curves to find what works best for each specific context.

## Spring Animations 

- Spring animations create more natural motion than traditional CSS animations by mimicking real-world physics (using mass, tension, and velocity parameters) rather than relying on fixed durations.
- Unlike standard easing animations, spring animations are interruptible - they maintain momentum when redirected, creating smoother transitions when animations need to change mid-execution.
- Spring animations can be configured using either technical parameters (stiffness, damping, mass) or the more intuitive approach of perceptual duration and bounce, though excessive bounce should typically be avoided for elegant UI.
- While spring animations feel more natural, implementing true spring animations in CSS is currently impossible (only approximations exist), requiring JavaScript libraries like Framer Motion or React Spring.
- Spring animations are particularly valuable for components involving motion (toggles, sheets, interactive cards), though the developer must balance the improved user experience against increased bundle size when using animation libraries.

## Timing and Purpose

- Duration should be carefully considered based on context - generally 200-300ms is the sweet spot, with faster durations (around 150ms) for hover states and slightly longer durations for larger visual changes.
- Animations should primarily add context to the user experience - they should help explain concepts, indicate state changes, or guide attention rather than being purely decorative.
- Consider frequency of user interaction when deciding to animate - frequently used elements or keyboard interactions should have minimal/no animation to avoid making the interface feel slow or disconnected.
- Well-crafted animations should be used sparingly and strategically - overanimating creates visual fatigue, while thoughtfully placed animations can create moments of delight without overwhelming users.
- The perceived speed of your interface matters - animations longer than 700ms should be exceptions, as shorter animations generally contribute to a snappier, more responsive feeling application.

## Taste
 
- Taste in animation design is about making aesthetic judgments and having the ability to form gut opinions that you can rationally justify—it's often the deciding factor in whether a product feels good.
- The gap between recognizing good design and creating it yourself is bridged through consistent practice, creation, and studying exceptional examples—record animations you admire and study them frame by frame to understand their details.
- Surrounding yourself with high-quality work accelerates improvement—create a personal collection of references, study how companies like Apple and Vercel implement animations, and analyze what makes certain interactions feel satisfying.
- Care is fundamental to developing good taste—the most memorable products show evidence that their creators paid attention to details and were stubborn about quality standards.
- Exposing yourself to diverse animation styles (like those on Awwwards) helps refine your sense of motion and understanding of easing, even if you wouldn't implement those exact styles in your own work.
