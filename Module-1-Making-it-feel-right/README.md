## What makes an animation feel right?
- Natural Movement: Animations feel better when they mimic natural movement rather than using linear timing, which feels robotic. Real-world objects don't move at constant speeds, which is why easing and spring animations create more pleasing experiences.
- Meaningful Purpose: Good animations should have clear meaning and purpose, connecting actions to consequences in logical ways. They should help users understand relationships between different states of the interface.
- Tasteful Implementation: Taste is a critical factor in whether animations feel good, and this skill can be developed with practice and experience. Finding the right balance is essential - animations should enhance without overwhelming.
- Web Challenges: Creating natural animations on the web is particularly challenging due to the abstraction layer of mouse/keyboard interaction (vs. touch) and technical limitations compared to native platforms, but proper easing and thoughtful design can still achieve excellent results.

## The Easing Blueprint
I use different easing types depending on what I'm animating:

Ease-out: My most frequently used curve for UI work. Great for user-initiated interactions like opening modals because the initial acceleration creates a responsive feeling. I apply this for most enter and exit animations.
Ease-in-out: Starts slowly, speeds up, then slows down at the end (like a car). This creates the most satisfying visual flow. I use it for on-screen elements that need to move to new positions or transform.
Ease-in: Starts slowly and ends fast. I generally avoid this as it can make interfaces feel sluggish and unresponsive.
Linear: Moves at constant speed, creating robotic motion. I only use this for continuous animations like loading spinners or marquees where there's no interaction.
Ease: Similar to ease-in-out but asymmetrical (starts faster, ends slower). I typically use this for hover effects that transition color, background, or opacity.

I've found that built-in CSS easing curves often don't have strong enough acceleration, so I frequently use custom cubic-bezier curves for more energetic, natural-feeling animations.
The perception of speed is often more important than actual performance - proper easing can make interfaces feel faster even when the duration stays the same. When in doubt, I refer to my easing blueprint and experiment with different curves to find what works best for each specific context.
